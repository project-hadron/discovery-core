Capability Fundamentals
-----------------------

Capabilities are components that adhere to the fundamental concepts
of `capability  patterns`_ and `separation of concern`_ (SoC). They are design patterns
and principle that advocates breaking a software system into distinct, independent
modules or components with, low coupling and high cohesion each addressing a specific
concern or aspect of the system's functionality.

Capabilities are reusable and encapsulated tasks which can be applied at any stage of the
life cycle and prescribes a work breakdown structure of functionalities and features a
software solution possesses.

**Capability patterns** is a design pattern that express and communicate process knowledge
for a key area of interest, such as a discipline, and can be directly used by process
practitioners to guide their work. Capability patterns are also used as building blocks
to assemble delivery processes ensuring optimal reuse and application of the key
practices they express

**Separation of concerns** is a design principle that advocates breaking a software
system into distinct, independent modules or components, each addressing a specific
concern while advocating low coupling and high cohesion. This approach aims to enhance
maintainability, scalability, and flexibility by isolating different concerns. It
advocates the modification and extension of specific components without affecting others,
leading to a more modular and comprehensible system.

Together, capability patterns help in understanding what a reusable component task should
achieve, while separation of concerns ensures that the component task is designed in a
modular and maintainable way, with each part addressing a specific aspect of its
functionality. Both principles contribute to building directed, modular, robust and
scalable software solutions.
